I'm an first-year master's student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ). I'am fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Miao Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangmiao). previously, I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at HITSZ in 2024.

My reasearch interest focus on *Learning Theory*, particularly the theoretical understanding of large foundation model from *training dynamic* and *generalization*.
